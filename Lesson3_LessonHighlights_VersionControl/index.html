            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control (VCS) is a modern system or program that records the changes made to a file or files over any period of time so that any versions of the file or files can be recalled later on. This type of system is perfect for web and graphic designers because it allows for comparison between new and old files since all versions are saved. Also, this system can save a lot of time and pain for a web designer because if any mistakes have been made or any files have been lost, there will be older versions to recover the lost files from.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To elaborate more specifically about Version Control Systems (VCS), a Local Version Control System is a type of Version Control System on a “local computer” that allows for automatic and simple organization and handling of files and the revisions made to each of them. This program helps web and graphic designers by preventing them to make any file organizational errors due to manual allocation and moving around files or a file within a folder or folders and directories. Many computers, such as Mac OS X operating system contains a local Version Control System called RCS that saves all of the changes made within files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Other than Local Version Control Systems, there is a form of Version Control Systems called Centralized Version Control Systems. This type of Version Control System allows for collaborative work between web and graphic designers. Centralized Version Control Systems are great for collaborative work because it allows for designers to be constantly updated on the work that has been accomplished within a project by other web designers. A main issue of this sort of Version Control System is that when the server is down, that contains all of the collaborative files and folders, no work or changes can be saved until it is back up.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The most complex form of a Version Control System is a Distributed Version Control System. A Distributed Version Control System comes to the rescue if a web or graphic designer wants to avoid any and all issues using a collaborative server can cause. Distributed Version Control Systems do not just save snap shots of the saved files, but the entire clone of the saved files. This is way more beneficial and efficient than using a Centralized Version Control System because if the server crashes, the project will not be affected. All of the files are fully backed up within a Distributed Version Control System.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">History of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Now that the different forms of Version Control Systems have been covered, an example of a Distributed Version Control System is a program called Git. Git was created due to a controversial split between the Linux kernel and the commercial company that created BitKeeper. This split inspired the Linux creator to create his own Distributed Version Control System that they could use based off of the aspects of BitKeeper. The new program they created was meant to be faster, simpler, more full distribution, more able to handle large projects like Linux kernel, and stronger for thousands of more parallel branches. </p>
